<p> I feel I have done everything I could to meet the project brief, from preparation for the project with the use of Trello to track and keep up with all my tasks and hitting deadlines, to the content I researched and combined together for my website by answering all the questions that was provided and the different skills and techniques I managed execute in order to format, construct and create my website. <p>

<p> I feel that I have hit the brief with my website, as it is easy to navigate and very user friendly. The formatting that I used is appropriate for the tasks I have been asked to carry out for this project with no error pages on my website as I had carried out numerous testing every time I added a new coding to each of my pages. </p>
