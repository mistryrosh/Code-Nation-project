<h1 class ="heading"> Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h1>

<p> Some of the risks that might cause digital projects to fail, are not having a though understanding of the scope and objective of the project which can leading to unclear goals and targets. Lack of interest and communication between team members resulting in lack of or no planning on all the task alongside poor project management, causing multiple problems throughout the project. This could also lead to confusion of roles and responsibilities within the team. </p>

<p>Lack of resources can also lead to failure of many IT projects due to not being able to complete the task at it’s given deadline and being able to execute the full vision of the end goal of the project.</p>
