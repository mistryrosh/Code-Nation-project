<h1 class ="heading"> Describing the purpose of IT in modern business. </h1>

<p> Information Technology is now widely used in modern businesses. IT fosters innovation in businesses and enables businesses to be connected to their customers and clients in various ways such as smarter apps, improved data storage, faster processing, and wider information distribution. The innovation of technology makes businesses run more efficiently, and innovation increases value, enhances quality, and boosts productivity, this allows businesses to be on the cutting edge of research with the increased computing power. <P>

<p>The purpose of IT within the modern business is to increase its efficiency for example there are technologies available to monitor a business's stock levels and let the company's know the costs they incur when they hold onto stock too long. These types of information allow for more informed decision making by companies. </p>

<p>Technology also allows for a faster response to any emergencies within a business by allowing its employees to connect to each other anywhere in the world at anytime, which ensures the business is able to be flexible and respond to changes quickly. </p>

<p>Technology plays a vital role in keeping not only the company's information such as trade secrets, upcoming projects, anything that gives it an advantage over its competitors but also its clients information safe and secure from an ever growing technological threat. [2]</p>
