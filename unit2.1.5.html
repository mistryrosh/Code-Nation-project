<h1 class ="heading"> Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites. </h1>

<p> Copyright is one of the main types of intellectual properties, which allows copyright owners to protect them against others copying or replicating their work. This gives them ownership over the work they create, and the work must be original meaning it should be originated with the author, who would have used some judgement or skill in its creation, for example if you blog, take photographs, publish music, or otherwise produce copyrightable content, you legally own that content. <a href="https://www.cla.co.uk/what-is-copyright">cla</a> <P>

<p>Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what content you are able to publish on your website for example photographs and specific design types which are already owned by someone. If you wish to use content that you have found online you may firstly need to seek permission from the original creator. </p>

<p>Although websites can be copywritten to protect themselves they will first need to meet certain criteriaâ€™s in order for this to happen such as the original work of the author, fixed to a platform that allows the site to be perceived or communicated and minimal amount of creativity. Even though a website can be copywritten it does not prevent ideas or methods to create a website from not being used by someone else.</p>
