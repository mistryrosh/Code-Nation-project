<h1 class ="heading"> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello. </h1>

<p> As the tools that I used throughout this project were free systems, I feel that they were great in executing the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the course to help me build my website. <p>

<p> Visual Studio Code helped me to execute the vision I had for my website with the use of HTML for constructing my website and CSS for being creative. Trello also helped me in managing my tasks throughout the project alongside Slack as I able to easily access course materials which were uploaded to the Slack channel. </p>
