<h1 class ="heading"> Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. </h1>
<p>The ways in which I plan and carry out tasks using IT is firstly through creating a Kanban board in Trello to plan and organise my workflow and content as I feel that this is a great project management tool for what I aim to accomplish for this task. A link to my Trello board can be found here <a href="https://trello.com/b/NfG9mApq/html-css-project.">Trello</a>  </p>

<p>I will then conduct research and draw up clear content which I would like to appear on my website. I will then create a site map that is clear and user friendly i.e easy to navigate with clear concise landing pages.</p>

<p>I then move on to focusing on the design, look and feel of the webpage as this what captivates and draws people in, therefore I will be creative and have theme that will flow through all my web pages. As I am using resources from other websites, I will be adding in references in order to which covers me legally from plagiarism.</p>

<p>Finally, I will conduct testing in order to ensure everything runs smoothly, all webpages are user friendly and easy to navigate and all content and tabs are aligned and in the correct space with great visual appearance.</p>
