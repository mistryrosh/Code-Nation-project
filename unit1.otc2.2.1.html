<h1 class ="heading"> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello. </h1>
<br>
<h3> Tools used to construct my website </h3>
<br>
<p> To construct my website, I used a number of tools which consists of: Visual Studio Code, Trello, fonts.google.com and google images. All of which I found to be very useful as it helped me to get to my end goal for this project which I am happy with the outcome of. <p>
<br>
<h3> Visual Studio Code </h3>
<br>
<p> The use of Visual Studio Code played a key part in helping me create my website from start to finish. The system helped me in constructing each page on my website using HTML and with the use of CSS I was able to be creative and apply different fonts, font size, alignment, centring, padding alongside much more such as the beautiful background image I have on my website and the transparent buttons. </p>
<br>
<h3> Trello </h3>
<br>
<p> Trello was a great tool to use for this project to plan and organise my workflow. I was able to track everything I did with the ability to have a ‘To do’ list to help me keep on track of things and what I needed to do next. Alongside tracking outstanding work which I felt I needed to re visit.</p>
<br>
<h3> The Internet </h3>
<br>
<p> The internet came very useful in many ways for this project, such as being able to conduct research for both Unit 1 Outcome 1 and Unit 2 Outcome 1, alongside being able to research the different coding techniques I could use to make my website more creative. The internet also helped in the types of fonts I used on my website and the background image which was used, whereby I was able to use fonts.google.com to import the different styles I have used on website for headings and paragraphs.</p>
