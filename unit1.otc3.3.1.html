<h1 class ="heading"> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h1>

<p> For more productivity and efficiency throughout this project I could have used Visual Studio Code to test and run my coding appropriately, as this was something I did not do. I relied on my coding to reflect on my website and continuously used this platform to check for any errors or inefficiencies. <p>

<p> However, if this project was carried out in a team, I believed I would have utilized Visual Studio Code more in running my coding script, as we would have worked on separate elements of the project and constructed it together, as this would have been the best way to do things for this project similarly to the previous task carried out of building a game using Python as a team. </p>

<p>Teamwork would have also increased the productivity of using more different tools such as Zoom or Google.meet which would have been very efficient for communication amongst the team, with daily stand ups. </p>

<p>Draw.io may have also been used to construct a flow chart of all our ideas and come up with a clear goal/vision for the project. </p>
