<h1 class ="heading"> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h1>
<p>With the time that was given to carry out this project and the limited knowledge I had with coding I am very happy with what I have created and achieved with the final outcome of my website. I feel that my website is captivating to the eye, user friendly and easy to navigate with the key content required for this project. </p>
<br>
<h3> Tools used to construct my website </h3>
<br>
<p> To construct my website, I used a number of tools which consists of: Visual Studio Code, Trello, fonts.google.com and google images. All of which I found to be very useful as it helped me to get to my end goal for this project which I am happy with the outcome of. <p>
<br>
<h3> Strengths </h3>
<br>
<p> TOne of my biggest strengths that I have always carried with me is my organisational skills, however for this project I found that the use of the Kanban board on Trello played a big part in helping me keep track of all the tasks I needed to carry out as there were many elements of the project that needed to be piece together and be worked on at the same time. This also helped in time management of deadlines set throughout the project. </p>

<p>Whilst carrying out this project I learnt the fundamentals of what both HTML and CSS can do and I became very competent in using both systems with the help of the course materials which I found very useful, in order to figure out what syntaxes to use for what I am trying to achieve throughout each element of the project. </p>
<br>
<h3> Trello </h3>
<br>
<p> Trello was a great tool to use for this project to plan and organise my workflow. I was able to track everything I did with the ability to have a ‘To do’ list to help me keep on track of things and what I needed to do next. Alongside tracking outstanding work which I felt I needed to re visit.</p>
<br>
<h3> Weaknesses </h3>
<br>
<p> As this was the first time I have ever done coding and used coding systems such as HTML and CSS in Visual Studio code I felt I like I could have done more in utilizing more of the skills I had learnt throughout the course, however due to the lack of time I had for the project I was unable to so. </p>

<p>Whilst carrying out this project I have come to realise that great attention to detail is needed to become a software developer and this is where I feel I could improve myself, in order to avoid me troubleshooting things when they are not working such as error pages. Small mistakes such as miss spelling folder names, missing a full stop, comer or hyphen held me back.</p>

<p>Finally, I felt that Flexbox was one of my weaknesses as I was not able to utilize this on project, therefore I feel weak in using it as I did not get much practice in using it.</p>
