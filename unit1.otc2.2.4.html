<h1 class ="heading"> Describe further improvements you can make to your project. </h1>

<p> With the limited time I had to construct this project, if more time was given I would have tested and played around with the layout of my website more and tested more background images and font styles and sizing to make the website as perfect as I would have wanted it to be. <p>

<p> I would have also researched and tested other forms of coding techniques that can be used on HTLM and CSS to make my website more friendly and maybe find a different way of condensing the amount of pages I have used for each unit and implemented this. </p>
