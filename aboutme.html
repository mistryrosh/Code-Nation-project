<h1> About Me </h1>
<br>
<h3> My background </h3>
<br>
<p> My name is Roshni Mistry and one of my biggest passions is Travelling. I have graduated with a BA degree in International Tourism Management where I spent one of my academic years abroad, comprised of 6months studying in Madrid and 6months working in the Hospitality industry in the fabulous island of Tenerife. As much as I love a relaxed sun, sea and sand holiday I am quite an adventure junky, where I have climbed mountains in Norway, Croatia and the Kilimanjaro in Arusha located in Tanzania whilst backpacking around Africa. </p>
<br>
<h3> My Interest in Technology & Coding </h3>
<br>
<p class="textBackground">I have always worked in the Travel industry where I got my first taste in technology as a Connectivity and Implementation coordinator for a large OTA company. This opened my eyes to the evolving world of technology and the different aspects there are in the digital world. Having conducted this role for a year I began to look for new challenges and development where I then became a qualified Health and Safety office. This enabled me to fulfil my passion of travelling as the role consisted of travelling the world inspecting hotels. However, this then ended, and I found myself back into technology carry out the role as Product Load Manger. This captivated me and gave me the drive that I needed through the numerous troubleshoot I had to carry out and the ability to use and learn a new system. This role consisted of working very closely with the digital and web team where I got an insight of whatâ€™s involved in types of systems used which bought me to where I am today of conducting this course with Code Nation.</p>
