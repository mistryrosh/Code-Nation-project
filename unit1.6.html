<h1 class ="heading"> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. â€“ How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control. </h1>

<p> In order to carry my first website creation project, I have chosen to use Trello as my project management tool and Visual Studio Code for coding using Python and HTML for coding. </p>

<p>Trello has helped me in many ways to project manage and to organise my workflow of each task I aim to carry out for the project. It helps me to track and understand what tasks have been completed, those that are in progress of being worked on and those that are outstanding and need completing. </p>

<P>The use of Visual Studio has helped me to code and piece my website together.</P>
