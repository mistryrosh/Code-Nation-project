<h3> Content used </h3>
<br>
<p> The content and research that was used to carry out this project was very educational for me. I got to learn a lot about what goes into being a Software developer, the legislations that are out there which needs to be followed, the skills and methods needed to complete a digital project and the different issues that people may face with websites. <p>
<br>
<h3> Layout of the website </h3>
<br>
<p> The aim of the design and layout of my website was to be simple yet attractive and appealing to the eye, alongside being user friendly and easy to navigate, which I feel I have achieved with the choice of image used, the fonts and colours chosen and the choice of buttons I have used to navigate to each page. </p>

<p> If I had more time to play around with the layout of my website I feel like I could have presented more, such as use of Flexbox, use of more div to add more spacing, moving buttons around etc, however overall I am very happy with the final product of my website.</p>
