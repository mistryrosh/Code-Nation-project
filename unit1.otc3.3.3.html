<h1 class ="heading"> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h1>

<p> If I were to carry out this project again I would maybe work within a team to see how the project will turn out in comparison to mine as there will be execution of various different ideas from other team members and I would possible be able to learn how others work and see if I could pick up new skills alongside new coding techniques. <p>

<p> Teamwork would also enable the use of more tools such as Zoom and Slack to be more collaborative, organise and conduct meetings to share ideas, daily stand ups and set daily goals and task deadlines. Which means that tasks will be divided, and the direction of the project would be different and possibly bigger. </p>
