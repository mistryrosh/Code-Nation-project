<h1 class ="heading"> Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. </h1>

<p> Some of the issues that people with disabilities may face when using websites, are difficulty in seeing the screen due to visual impairment, use of colour on websites and use of subtitles. <p>

<p> In order to support users that are visually impaired, an audio tool can be used which would read the words from the webpage, similarly for images the use of alt tag and descriptive writing would allow the visually impaired to know what images are on the screen through the audio tool. Another important aspect to consider is the use of colour for the website, i.e using black text on a white background allows users with colour blindness to use the website. </p>

<p> Subtitles and transcripts are a good way of conveying what is being said or any actions carried out by individuals on a any audio or video files. These will help support users that have hearing impairment. </p>
