<h1 class ="heading"> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h1>

<p> Through my experience in carrying out this project I would conduct user testing at each stage of my page building to avoid any errors, I would also cross check all content has been loaded properly with no mistakes such as spelling or grammar. <p>

<p> I would enforce code review, therefore if possible, get another pair of eyes to look over my coding. If working as a team there would have been more peer checking. </p>

<p>Once the end product is finish I would finally ensure the everything works fine and is itâ€™s correct formatting space, all tabs follow through to a landing page and all menu bars and links work as they are supposed to as great attention to detail is really needed for a project of this scale. </p>
