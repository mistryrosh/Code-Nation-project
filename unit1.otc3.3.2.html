<h1 class ="heading"> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h1>

<p> For more productivity and efficiency throughout this project I could have used Visual Studio Code to test and run my coding appropriately, as this was something I did not do. I relied on my coding to reflect on my website and continuously used this platform to check for any errors or inefficiencies. <p>

<p> I feel all that could have been done for better productivity and efficiency throughout this project was done. Tea/coffee breaks were taken in the morning and evening alongside an hour for lunch which helped in rejuvenating ourselves and powering our inner batteries ready to carry on with the tasks set. </p>

<p> At times I took regular time away from the screen especially when focusing on a problem for a very long time, alongside constantly being hydrated which helped me to get back into where I left of and be more productive. </p>

<p> The weekly Yoga session that Code Nation holds is a great way of relaxation to the mind, body and sole and I would highly recommend it especially when learning something new that is out of your comfort zone such as this course for myself. </p>
